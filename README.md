# A first try of ECommerce

I followed this [YT video](https://youtu.be/377AQ0y6LPA) and learned a lot

Pretty amazing tool [ECommerce.js](https://commercejs.com/)

## Deployment

This will be deployed once I'm done.

## Get it to work on your computer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcusoftnet/demo-ecommercejs
cd demo-ecommercejs
npm i
npm start
```

This will start a server on port <http://localhost:3000>
